## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser #TODO

## My process

1) Raw HTML markup
2) CSS styling
3) Theme switching script
4) Early calculator functionality
5) Desktop workflow
6) Copy functionality
7) Fixes/polishes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Hover CSS]([https://reactjs.org/](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover)) - Custom CSS effects collection

### What I learned

This was my first project done using JS classes and CSS variables. In the end I got stylesheet and calculator script both of which are easily customizable.

### Continued development

I might do theme preferences saving sometime in the future. Might not. Who knows.

### Useful resources

- [I hate regex](https://ihateregex.io/playground/) - Useful regex playground, helps with visualising regex logic.
- [Grid cheatsheet](https://www.example.com) - Pretty self-explanatory.
